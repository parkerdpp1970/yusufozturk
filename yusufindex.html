            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>At 1.76 m tall, Yusuf Ozturk, a 41-year-old computer programmer and team manager residing just outside Istanbul, Turkey, wants to regain his fitness. Once an accomplished long-distance runner in his twenties, Yusuf’s athletic pursuits took a backseat to the demands of a thriving career and a growing family. Married and a father of three, his life is full and busy. However, his physical activity has significantly diminished over the past decade, and he has not exercised regularly. He has never been a gym-goer, preferring to be outside, hitting the streets and running for miles.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Yusuf's professional role is highly stressful; he is often in the office before 8 a.m. every day and frequently stays late to manage his team and project deadlines. He admits that when stress levels are high, he can go an entire day without eating anything, only to gorge on large amounts of food once he finally returns home. This erratic cycle of fasting and overeating has become a major concern for him.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">He now wants to return to running for personal fulfilment and to connect with his children, who are active in the local athletics club. He hopes to improve his fitness so he can comfortably run with them and possibly complete a half marathon. Yusuf values maintaining muscle mass as he ages but dislikes gyms and weight training, seeking alternative guidance. He also wants to lose weight, having risen from 70kg to around 80kg.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Although Yusuf does not have much free time, balancing long working hours with his duties as a "taxi service" for his children’s athletics, he is committed to establishing a routine of three to four sessions per week. He finds that weekends are generally the most reliable time for these sessions, along with early mornings, as his evenings are typically occupied by his children's training meets if he is home in time.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Yusuf feels his diet is generally balanced, with most meals prepared at home by his wife. However, he acknowledges a tendency towards large portions and the aforementioned "gorging" habit, which may contribute to his current fitness and weight. Yusuf seeks advice on portion control, consistent meal timing, and nutritional adjustments to support his fitness goals.</p>
